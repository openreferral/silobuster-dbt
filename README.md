# SiloBuster! DBT
A straighforward DBT project that standardizes three source data sets and munges them into common HSDS tables (WIP).

Moving quick and dirty to a certain degree in order to meet the real time demands of a hackathon.

## Organization.
Generally following DBT best practices for model organization (https://docs.getdbt.com/guides/best-practices/how-we-structure/1-guide-overview), but wiht an extra layer of folders identifying the different contributor data sets.
